# ZimaBoard-BIOS

ZimaBoard's BIOS and Issues Tracker.

Due to the special nature of the BIOS, the BIOS does not have a very fast update cycle like other software.



> # âš  Attention
> If no one explicitly tells you that you should update a certain ZimaBoard version to a certain version of BIOS.
> **Please do not update!!!**
> 
> If your ZimaBoard is running normally, upgrading the BIOS is not recommended!!!
> Please contact support@icewhale.org as a priority for any issues.
> 
> !!! Improper operation can cause the machine to fail to start.
> !!! Flashing the wrong version can also cause the machine to fail to boot.
